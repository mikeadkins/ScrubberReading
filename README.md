This program is used to help calculate air readings on square or rectangle ductworks with pitot tube. My personal use of these readings are with mining machinery. The scrubbers are used to remove dust from the air and proper readings are necessary to determine this. The readings are taken with a Pitot Tube which reads velocity pressure inside the duct. The difficult part of the process is converting from velocity pressure, measured in inches of mercury, to velocity measured in linear feet per minute. The formula for this being: 4005 * sqrt/vp with vp being velocity pressure. The linear feet velocity must be known to calculate cubic feet per minute which determines if the proper amount of air is moving. 
This is only the second program I have ever created and I am learning with every experience. Please feel free to give me any suggestions that would help the program or my learning. Thanks.
